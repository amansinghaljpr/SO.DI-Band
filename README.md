# SO.DI-Band
SODI BAND is a type of smart band that uses RF technology to detect the presence of another person near you . And helps you maintain social distancing.

## Why did i make it (THE PROBLEM) ?? 

Also this project is helpful for the hospitals so that they know they are on a safe distance from the patients. 
Sometimes we are no conscious enough to maintain a social distance but this band will help you to make a safe eco-system with a socially distant environment for the employees.
Also as apple and google have joined hands together to build something knows as CONTACT TRACING DEVICE OR APP  ,  so even i wanted to try my hand at it

## **Solution**

The simple solution was SODI BAND which is equipped with state of the art RF technology which will detect any person coming near to you wearing the same band . 


## **Features of this band:**

As it is WiFi capable it can also connect to the wifi router and data to a server where you can check with whom in day you came in contact with or simply put it acts as a CONTACT TRACING DEVICE 
As portable as a watch 
Capable of detecting person from up to 20m (which can be adjusted from 1m to 20m)
Helps you maintain social distance without you taking conscious care about it
Further developments
As we were stuck in a lockdown i tried to make it as feasible as possible. The final version will be like a band with the whole circuit inside it. You can wear it like a watch and instead of an LED and Buzzer there will be HAPTIC feedback like a vibration motor to alert it , an APP to see the data etc
